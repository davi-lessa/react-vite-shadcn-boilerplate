# React + Vite - boilerplate: ready to clone

## About

Welcome! As a developer, I understand how tedious it can be to set up a new project from scratch. That's why I created this ready-made starter project to help you quickly build web applications with React and Vite + TailwindCSS + ShadCN.

## What is included in this version?

- Vite
- React
- React Router DOM
- React Query
- Redux
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- ShadCN (Slate Theme)
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Lucide Icons

Features like: absolute imports

## Making a Copy

Clone this repository with the command below

```
git clone https://github.com/davi-lessa/react-vite-shadcn-boilerplate.git
```

Then run these

```
cd react-vite-shadcn-boilerplate
git init
pnpm i
```

For development run Vite with `pnpm run dev`

Other commands will be listed soon.
